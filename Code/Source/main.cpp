/*
	This is an example implementation of some of the results described in the paper.
	Three scenes (in three different files) can be run to export an .obj file.

	To minimize dependencies, no realtime viewer is provided, and all input heightfields are
	defined analytically with noise primitives. To compute the final isosurface, a public
	domain marching-cube implementation is used.
	
	If you have any questions or problem to compile the code, you can contact me at:

/*!
\brief Running this program will export some
meshes similar to the ones seen in the paper. Each scene
is in its own file and contains all the algorithms necessary
to reproduce it.
